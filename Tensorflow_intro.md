# TensorFlow Tutorial Notes

### Module 1 : Introduction



#### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Vs Machine Learning (ML) Vs Neural Networks (NN) 
#### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* AI is the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

#### Machine Learning (ML)
* ML generates the rules from the data. 
* ML is a subset of AI

#### Neural Networks (NN)
* NN : A form of ML that uses a layered representation of data.
* NN is a subset of ML 

### DATA - Features and Labels
* "Features" are the input information that are fed into the ML Model. The Model predicts the output "Labels".

### Different types of Machine Learning
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

#### Supervised Learning
In Supervised learning, the features are mapped to labels through a set of rules and the task of the ML model is to provide this set of rules.


#### Unsupervised Learning
In the Unsupervised learning, the labels are absent. The model takes in the features and tries to find the group/clusters data points.


#### Reinforcement Learning
In the Reinforcement learning, we don't have any data (i.e. Features or Labels). We have an "Agent", an "Environment" and a "Reward". There are two important process in the Reinforcement learning.
* The Agent does the random search in the environment and the rewards for each search is recorded. 
* The recorded reward directs the Agent to the desired goal.
The task is to maximise the reward.
